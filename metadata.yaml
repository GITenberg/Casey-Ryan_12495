description: Though she made her name as one of the first female authors to achieve
  widespread popularity as a writer of Westerns, B. M. Bower's later work broached
  the fascinating subject of the way that new technologies changed life on the range
  forever. In Casey Ryan, the speed-loving stagecoach driver of the title meets his
  match in a brand-new motorcar.
